                    Hi I'm Malia, welcome to my portfolio! I started my web development journey in August 2023, and recently graduated from UCI's The Coding Bootcamp. It has been so fun to learn how to code, and there is still so much for me to learn. I'm happy you're here! Here are a few things to know about me: I drink too much iced coffee, I love Kpop, I go to a lot of concerts, and I will ask to see pictures of your pets.
